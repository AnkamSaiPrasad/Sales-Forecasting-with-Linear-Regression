# Sales Forecasting with Linear Regression
This Project is focused on Forecasting/Predicting Sales using Linear Regression algorithm. 
This project also demonstrates how to use **Linear Regression** to forecast future sales based on historical data. It involves loading and preprocessing sales data, training a regression model, and generating both tabular and graphical forecasts.

## Project Structure

- `Sourcecode.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for data analysis, model training, and forecasting.
- `sales_data.csv` â€“ The dataset containing historical sales records used for training the model.
- `Output_Screenshots.pdf` â€“ Visual documentation of model training and prediction results.

## Project Highlights

- âœ… Data loading and preprocessing using `pandas`
- ðŸ“‰ Training a **Linear Regression** model from `sklearn`
- ðŸ“Š Visualizing both the training performance and future sales forecasts
- ðŸ“ˆ Generating **tabular** and **graphical** forecast outputs

## Sample Outputs

Included in `Output_Screenshots.pdf`:
- Training summary and regression line
- Forecasted sales table
- Future sales trend graph

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn
- CSV for data input
- PDF for output documentation
